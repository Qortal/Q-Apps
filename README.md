# Qortal Project - Example Q-Apps

## Examples
The [examples](examples/) folder contains some sample Q-Apps. These can be used as reference guides or starting points when building a new Q-App.

## Languages
Q-Apps support any client-side javascript frameworks or approaches. Initial examples will be in React and vanilla javascript, but these are by no means the only options for structuring a Q-App.

## Documentation
See: [Q-Apps documentation](https://github.com/Qortal/qortal/blob/master/Q-Apps.md) for developer docs and info on how to get started.
